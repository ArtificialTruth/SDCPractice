   The developers of *sdcMicro* have also developed a graphical user
   interface (GUI) for the package, which is contained in the *sdcMicro* package available from the CRAN mirrors. The GUI,
   however, does not implement the full functionality of the *sdcMicro*
   package and is not discussed in this guide. The GUI can be called after loading sdcMicro by typing sdcApp() at the prompt.
